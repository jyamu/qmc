Participants
- Jeongnim Kim, Paul Kent, Jaron Krogel and Cynthia Gu, ORNL
- David Ceperley, Norman Tubman, Raymond Clay, University of Illinois
- Jeffrey Greeley, William Parker, Anouar Benali and Nick Romero, ANL
- Miguel Morales, Jeremy McMinis, Jonathan Dubois (remote), LLNL

\section plan Planning

Continue discussion and complete the main parts in Q1
- More work on PP required
 - non-local PP gradient
 - T-move
 - Jastrow forms
- Optimization to use parallel library
 - Scalapack over MPI
 - MAGMA on hybrid machines
 - Multiple eigen states and store them: extend the MSD XML notation
- Multideterminants
 - Interface to Wannier 90 
 - Parallel eigen solvers
 - Initiate the discussion with Molpro (Peter) and GAMESS (Theresa) developers to estabilish common format and tools
- Common needs emerging to perform CEIMC, Adiabatic QMC and "NEB" calculations
 - Memory optimization
 - Wavefunction capability to handle change in ionic configurations at low cost
 - QE integration; GAMESS??
- Tools
 - Extend Jaron' Project suite for GAMESS and other computing facilities
 - Visualization tools: Visit
- XML/HDF schema

\subsection incite2014 INCITE allocations
Instructions will be sent but these are important
- Everyone has to have accounts at OLCF to access the project directory to share data
- At OLCF, plan to create 4 subprojects and allocate 10 M for the first half
  of the year and will add more based on the burn rate
- At ALCF, 20% will be shared by others and the rest to ANL/Purdue
- Keep steady use and be careful in utilization
- docs/dev/glue_incite.dox will be prepared for the instruction by Anouar and J.
- Will seek solution for the persistent storage for large data 
  
\subsection school14 QMC school in 2014
- Date: 5 days during June/9-June/20
- Location
 - ALCF if no scheduling conflicts
 - NERSC
 - OLCF
- David and Anouar will start the big planning: timeline
 - Announcement at aps meeting (latest)
 - Statement of the school: goals, scope ang participants

- Targeted audience who will use QMC in their research
 - QMC groups: Zhang, Harvard, UCB, Burkhard, Richard, CASINO, UI, other european groups
 - Several QC groups: Ken Jordan, Theresa Windus/Mark Gordon, (add more)
 - vdW DFT groups: Northwestern, U Chicago, UI, Purdue, UBC, UT, MPI, Chalmers, Basel
- Computational resources will be secured at ALCF/OLCF.
- What to do during the school
 - QMC lectures
 - General tutorials with tools, pick a few representative problems
 - Everyone in the glue picks problem types and work with a few students one-to-one
 - NO: Some computations: OLCF/ALCF/NERSC all will be willing to provide 1-2 day tutorials on computationa

QMC + stochastic ES in 2015, Telluride, June 8-12,2015

- Suggestion: Miguel, Paul, David(?) + PD if other organizers 
- Shiwei, Cyrus, Lubos, Claudia, Sandro

\section app Science Discussion
