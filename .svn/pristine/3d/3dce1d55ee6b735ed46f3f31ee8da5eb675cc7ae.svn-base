 * \section build_sec Getting started
 * - Download source via svn
 *   - Developers' version: 
   \code
svn co https://subversion.assembla.com/svn/qmcdev/trunk qmcpack
     \endcode
 *   - Stable public version : 
 *   \code
 svn co http://qmcpack.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ qmcpack
     \endcode
 * - Build where everything is installed in standard directores, /usr, /usr/local
    \code
cd qmcpack/build
cmake ..
make -j4
    \endcode
    <p>
    Use any number of threads for parallel make. The example above used 4 threads with -j4 option.
    More on how to build QMCPACK can be found at http://qmcpack.cmscc.org/getting-started/cmake-101
    If everything goes well, then you should see \a qmcpack/build/bin/qmcapp.

  \section pre_sec Required tools and libraries

  - C/C++ compilers
  - cmake, build utility, http://www.cmake.org/
  - blas/lapack, numerical library, use platform-optimized libraries
  - libxml2, XML parser, http://xmlsoft.org/
  - hdf5, portable I/O library, http://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/
  - boost, peer-reviewed portable C++ source libraries, http://www.boost.org

Optional but required for a complete build 
  - einspline, 3D bspline library, http://einspline.sourceforge.net/
  - fftw, FFT library, http://www.fftw.org/

   \section extlib_sec External libraries
   <p>
   QMCPACK uses several third-party tools and libraries.  The selected packages
   are widely adopted by open-source communities and are generally available on
   HPC systems via module.  They are included in standard Linux/cygwin
   distributions or can be installed by standard tools like yum.
   Installing these libraries with the source codes is straightforward.  Because
   the header files are included by QMCPACK, it is important to install
   developers' version of each library.
