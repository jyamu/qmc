/*!  \mainpage Developers' guides   
QMCPACK is written in C++ and proficiency in C++ is required. Currently, C++03
standard is adopted and the transition to C++11 will start after the code
freeze at the end of 2013. MPI, OpenMP and CUDA are used for parallelizations.

The public version is available at https://code.google.com/p/qmcpack/ under
UIUC/NCSA open-source licence. Those who are interested in QMCPACK development
are strongly encouraged to contact J. Kim and other developers to establish
collaborations so that one can access to the developers' version.  Although it
is not required, the developers will appreciate if the new product can be
available to others when the research and development is published.  The
developers and users will comply with the constraints posed by the contributors
under the terms of the licence.

These tools are used in QMCPACK development and familiarity with them will be helpful in working with QMCPACK.
- Compilers : GNU, Intel and IBM compilers are tested and supported. There
  is no plan to support other compilers. 
- subversion : revision system
- cmake : 2.8 and later, build system
- doxygen : 1.8, code documentation and the guides (including this.)
