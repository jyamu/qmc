QMCPACK, an open-source QMC simulation code written in C++, implements advanced
continuum QMC algorithms for large-scale parallel computers. Its main
applications are electronic structure calculatinos of molecular, quasi-2D and
solid-state systems. Designed with the modularity afforded by object-oriented
architecture, it makes extensive use of template metaprogramming to achieve
high computational efficiency through inlined specializations. It utilizes a
hybrid (OpenMP,CUDA)/MPI approach to parallelization to take advantage of the growing
number of cores per SMP node or GPUs. Finally, it utilizes standard file formats for
input and output in XML and HDF5 to facilitate data exchange.
